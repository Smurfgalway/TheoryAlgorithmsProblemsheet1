# Theory Algorithms Problemsheets
This problem sheet is for my theory of algorithms module in college. This problem sheet requires the use of the racket lanugage to complete a list of programming tasks

what is racket?

Racket is a general purpose, multi-paradigm programming language in the Lisp-Scheme family. One of its design goals is to serve as a platform for language creation, design, and implementation.

What is visual Studio Code?

Visual Studio Code is a source code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. It includes support for debugging, embedded Git control, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring.

I used visual studio code as my text and code editor of choice. All my markdown files were created and edited in visual studio code and I commented my racket files with it.
